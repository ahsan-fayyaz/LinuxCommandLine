The file extension actually don't matter in linux

in order to check what type of file we have
1. go to terminal
2. type file myfilename.png // it will show what type of file is it
3. suppose now we change myfilename.jpg // which is another extension for picture

we run: file myfilename.jpg 
/*doesn't make any difference to what terminal shows, since in the linux, there is a header file which reads the code of the file and doesn't classify anything just according to the 
file extension*/


4. give files your own extension as long as they aren't the ones which already exist e.g
convert photo.txt can be converted to photo.sss will have no problem
but photo.txt converted to photo.pdf will cause a problem
