Aliases are nicknames for your commands or command pipelines which makes them easier to remember

how to make your very own command aliases?

suppose you have a very long command:
date | tee /home/csc103/fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 | tee home/csc103/day.txt | xargs echo hello

and we don't have to type it everytime, what we can do is instead is make an alias for this. so like a short nickname as a new command, 
which we can type into commandline to get the same input

HOW?

1. go to your home directory
2. create a special type of file:	.bash_aliases
3. a . at start of the file makes it hidden
4. syntax:

alias aliasName:"type the commands here"

5. now restart your terminal and run the new nickname of your command,
