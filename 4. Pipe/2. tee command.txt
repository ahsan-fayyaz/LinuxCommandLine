in the last example, the date was piped with the cut command to show only the first field i.e Day
however, what if we want to save this output i.e day into a .txt file as well, while at the same time also using cut command

there is a simple solution: tee command, this works as a t junction, sending command horizontally as well as, also saving whole date it vertically, at the 
same time

syntax:

date | tee file.txt | cut --delimiter " " fields 1 

and to redirect the output of cut command, use > after fields 1

usually after redirection no more piping can occur, however, you can use tee command to continue using pipe
