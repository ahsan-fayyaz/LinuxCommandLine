piping is connecting stdout of one command to stdin of another command

redirection breaks pipelines ( > )
so use tee command to save stuff and continue piping

if a command doesn't use stdin, use xargs to convert that stdin into commandline arguments
xargs can still have its own arguments besides the one piped
