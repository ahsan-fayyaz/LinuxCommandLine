when a certain command doesn't accept standard input but only commandline arguments,
xarg is used to convert stdin to commandline argument

suppose we have two files new.txt and old.txt
and we want to delete both files, there's one way use rm new.txt and rm old.txt

that's awesome
but suppose, we have another file named deletefiles.txt and it contains names:  new.txt old.txt
and then we want to delete these both files:

cat deletefiles.txt | xargs rm deletefiles.txt

what would this do? read whatever is inside deletefiles.txt, and then pipe it with xargs, which will convert it into commandline
arguments for the rm command, pretty simple!
