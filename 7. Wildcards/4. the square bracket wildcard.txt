suppose we have 6 files

file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt
fileA.txt
fileB.txt
fileC.txt

and we want only first three with numbers
how to do this?

-- example:
file[1234567890].txt

a shortcut is file[0-9]

so whatever is in the brackets, if it matches to the arguments given
it will show that file

/*also they just fill in one place*/


-- example:
what if we want fileA1.txt // since there are two digits
file[A-Z][0-9].txt

e.g:

file[0-9ABC]
