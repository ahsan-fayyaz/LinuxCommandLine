-- example:
use: ls *
since the * matches anything it puts it as command line arguments to ls command
this will list out contents of all the directories

-- example: list out anything that starts with D

syntax: ls D*
this means list out anything that starts with D followed by anything (since * represents anything)

-- example: list out anything that has .txt

syntax: ls *.txt
this means anything followed by .txt
